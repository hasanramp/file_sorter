# file_sorter
A one time file sorting application for linux. (I think it should work on windows as well)

## How to use
open config.json file
enter the name of the default directory you want to clean (the path is relative)
in patterns select the start and end text in the files. End name is compulsary. Start is optional
## Installation
clone repo and run file_sorter.py file
